\opening{Dear Scholarship review committee,}

It's my pleasure to recommend M. Uliah Shafar for your scholarship program. Uliah was one of my student in master degree at Universitas Diponegoro. I had taught him few subjects of architecture and also supervised him in his thesis. While I was interacting with him, he had successfully showed courage, enthusiasm, and hard work to get his task done. In my point of view, this made him as an outstanding student. Moreover, he had proven that by graduated with highest GPA and cum laude graduate.

We have made some interaction in the class with other classmates in few subjects for nearly one semester. However, after Covid breakdown, the class should be conducted online. Although some students showed lack of interest in online class, Uliah increased his discipline, attendance and completed task punctually. He is very flexible and reliable person, no matter how different the situation are. In every class meeting, before or after covid, Uliah always comes with groundbreaking idea, either by writing assignment, discussion or presentation. The class even more interesting, when he tried to involved by raising question, giving opinion, or commenting their classmate's ideas. He actively engaged with compassion and respect to all in his study group.

In his writing task, he wrote comprehensive and accurate ideas to any other topic that was given.
He is such the best writer
even though he must catch the deadline of more than a single task weekly. The immerse of improving his writing made his one article published in national journal of urban design in early stage of education. The article that he wrote is about the evaluation public space. This is not will be for the purpose of his education only but can be used for making contribution to society.


%I have known Uliah since he attended some my master's subjects in Universitas Diponegoro. My relationship was getting stronger when I had became supervisor of him for his thesis. While interaction, Uliah demonstrate good quality such as consistently accomplished tasks revision with dedication and enthusiast. Uliah showed an excelent  assignment writing with support of incredible and ramp up citation. He also one of students who graduated with camlaude. Therefore, I would like to recommend Uliah as prospective scholarship awardee.

\closing{Sincerely,}
